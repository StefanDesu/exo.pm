<div class="post-content">

In yesterday‚Äôs morning run, I ran almost 17 km! After the exam the day before, I really wanted to go for a long run. And a good friend of mine randomly ran a half marathon that day which inspired me to try my best and go for a really long run!</p>

<p>This also gives me a lot of confidence that I‚Äôm already at the level to run a half marathon if I wanted to. I think there are two half marathons in the surrounding area at the end of August / beginning of September, so I should consider joining one of those (or both? ü§î).</p>

<p>Already back in Japan, I wanted to make a video about what running means to me. And then Casey Neistat published a video just like that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjvH9urPM24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/hjvH9urPM24/mqdefault.jpg" alt="my addiction">Casey Neistat - my addiction</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I still like to come back to this video whenever I need some inspiration. Definitely worth a watch even if you‚Äôre not a runner!</p>

<p>Edit:
Just for fun, I made <a href="/running/">this page</a> which will track all my runs on Runtastic. üòÖ</p>
