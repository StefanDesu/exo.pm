<div class="post-content">
  <p>Hi there!</p>

<p>For today’s update post I’d like to go back to the kind of “traditional” update style of my first update posts. So I’ll choose a few topics and give you a little update on those!</p>

<h2 id="relist-the-app-im-currently-working-on">ReList (the app I’m currently working on)</h2>
<p>I’ve shared a little bit about the app I’m currently working on, but I haven’t said many concrete things about it. Today I’d like to go all open by telling you what kind of app it is and how you could help in its development.</p>

<p>So, the current working title is “ReList” which comes from “Reusable Lists”. It’s not fixed yet, but so far I haven’t had any better ideas for the name. My thought was that sometimes you have a checklist that you’d like to go through many times. Examples would be a morning and evening routine, packing lists for traveling, or project templates. Besides the routines, I personally also use it to prepare a new beta for the app itself. On there are things like “Archive build in Xcode” or “Write build notes” and lastly “Post a message in beta group”. Although it’s just six steps (at the moment), it’s helpful so that I don’t forget anything. You can either manually invoke these checklists, or configure repeating checklists that are created automatically. Of course you can use it as a regular checklist app for groceries and stuff as well.</p>

<p>Originally, I got the idea for the app from CGP Grey, a YouTuber and podcaster. In one of the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cortex</a> episodes, he talked about templates for checklists that he’s using whenever he prepares to post a new video or podcast episode. And because I couldn’t find a good app that does ONLY this, and among the well known task managers, only the more expensive ones have this feature, I decided that it would be nice to make my own app for it.</p>

<p>I’ve mentioned the beta for this app. I started development in the beginning of January and on 21 January I got the app through Apple’s beta review and officially started the TestFlight beta. I’ve also made a separate page for it with more infos and current task lists and build notes. You can find the page <a href="/relist-beta/">here</a>. If you’d like to participate in the beta, just send me your email address. ;) Currently, the progress has stagnated a bit, and the app is still far from release, but I’m hyped to work much more on it in March!</p>

<h2 id="flappicorn">Flappicorn</h2>
<p>I think I’ve talked about this in a previous post once, but I’m picking it up again now. I’ve rediscovered a game that I made for iOS a few years ago by going through a tutorial and modifying everything. Last summer, I ported the whole thing from Objective-C to Swift, but then forgot about it again. Now I’ve dug it up once more and it still compiles easily without any issues. It is a Flappy Bird clone (yes I know…), but instead of a bird, we used a unicorn! My flatmate actually made all the artwork for it. And I really think I should finish this game and put it onto the App Store. It still needs a proper interface and better music, and maybe I’ll add some in-app purchases and leaderboards, but the basic gameplay is already done basically. What do you think? Here’s a screenshot:</p>

<p><a href="/images/update020_flappicorn.png" data-title="Flappicorn Screenshot"><img src="/images/update020_flappicorn.png" alt="Flappicorn Screenshot" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:100%;max-width:300px;"></a></p>

<p>(That little thing under the lolli is a flying donut projectile that’ll kill you if you get hit by it. 😂)</p>

<h2 id="japanese">Japanese</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, my progress in Japanese is stagnating a little bit. I’m still doing my daily reviews (never ever will I skip a day!), but I’ve had so much other stuff on my mind that I didn’t make much progress. Recently, I’ve started watching a show on Netflix called “Dad of Light” in Japanese with Japanese subtitles. Netflix is actually really nice for that, and if the show’s content is not too complex, I can understand the gist of most of it. “Good Morning Call” would be a great candidate for this as well, but I’m watching it with my flatmates, so we need the English subtitles. But I think that this is pretty good listening practice even if some stuff is getting lost. You are forced to focus on the Japanese and the subtitles help a lot because of the kanji (my kanji knowledge is far ahead of my speaking and listening abilities…). I hope I can use this to make some progress and maybe learn some new words as well. :)</p>

<h2 id="spacex">SpaceX</h2>
<p>Have you seen SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy launch? If not, where have you been??? I think it is a must watch for anyone! Elon Musk sent a frickin’ Tesla into space! (I know it’s basically trashing the universe, but at least it’s not in our atmosphere.) <a href="https://youtu.be/wbSwFU6tY1c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is the video of the launch. The launch itself is around 21:55, but even more important is the crazy landing of the two booster rockets around 29:55. You should definitely open that video even if just for that!</p>

<h2 id="other-stuff">Other Stuff</h2>
<p>Since I haven’t prepared at all for this post to be honest, I’ll just put some stuff here that I found interesting lately.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apparently, <a href="https://mashable.com/2018/02/16/apple-park-glass-walls/#22gH8bwqf5q6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple employees keep walking into the glass walls of the new ‘spaceship campus’</a>. 😂😂😂 (Sorry to everyone who actually got hurt because of this. 😅)</li>
  <li>My friend showed me <a href="https://youtu.be/TMfStd3v330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this funny video about how to not sexually harass someone</a>. (And I think it’s horrible that there are actually men out there who do this kind of stuff and who don’t recognize or admit that it is a huge problem.)</li>
  <li>If you need something to cheer you up a little, you should watch <a href="https://youtu.be/J494R_Xeyys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video by Yes Theory</a>.</li>
  <li>We’ve been watching the Winter Olympics recently and in their opening show, they showed a clip where they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/9/16994638/winter-olympics-2018-intel-drone-show-world-record" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">used over 1200 small drones</a> with lights to perform a crazy light show! I didn’t know stuff like this was already possible. And scaling up in numbers apparently isn’t too big of a deal.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I searched more, I’d probably find a million more things I could put here, but I think this is enough for now. Let me know if you found some of the stuff as interesting as I did!</p>

<h2 id="see-you">See You!</h2>
<p>I noticed that I often have things I’d like to share and talk about, but I never use my blog for this kind of stuff (usually I just tweet it, but so few people are actually reading my tweets that those often get lost). So the next time I have a thought or an idea that I have stuff to say about, I’ll make a blog post out of it! That’s what a blog is for, isn’t it?</p>

<p>See you soon!</p>
