  <p>The last week of daily blogging is over. Only one post left for tomorrow which will be kind of a ‚Äúwhat I learned from this‚Äù post. So further thoughts on daily blogging in that post. üòâ</p>

<p>This week, I had some trouble coming up with good topics. On Monday and Tuesday, I had long days at work, so I started the week with two short posts about <a href="/2020/11/23/cold-showers/">cold showers</a> and <a href="/2020/11/24/climbing-my-favorite-sport/">climbing</a>. On Wednesday, I posted about some <a href="/2020/11/25/state-of-the-apps/">iPhone and iPad apps that I use</a> which was way more work than I had anticipated. On Tuesday, I wrote a follow-up post for last week‚Äôs <a href="/2020/11/21/the-voice-inside-your-head/">The Voice Inside Your Head</a>, titled <a href="/2020/11/26/who-are-you/">Who Are You?</a> It is definitely a very deep topic. On Friday, I made a list of <a href="/2020/11/27/2021-travel-destinations/">potential travel destinations for 2021</a>, in case it is possible to travel again, and yesterday I finally wrote somewhat of a <a href="/2020/11/28/the-iPhone-12-mini/">review of the iPhone 12 mini</a>, including some photos I have taken with it (someone asked for cat pics in the comments before, there you go).</p>

<p>Here are some recommendations for this week:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On Monday, I learned that Taiwan has a Digital Minister called Audrey Tang, and they are such an interesting person. You can read up on them on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang">Wikipedia</a>.</li>
  <li>A short 2:14 review of the M1 MacBook Air: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7-7YE33PsU">Quick &amp; Dirty Review of the MacBook Air with M1</a></li>
  <li>Yes Theory published a new video where Thomas went to Afghanistan for 96 hours. Highly recommended watch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J74B2jzr8iA">96 Hours Inside Afghanistan in 2020</a></li>
  <li>A funny and pretty interesting article about ‚Äúcomma ellipses‚Äù: <a href="https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/comma-ellipses">Why Do Young People Use Commas So Weirdly?</a></li>
  <li>A new Better Ideas video about gratitude: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQoS_S9K464">Why it‚Äôs so hard to be happy</a></li>
  <li>My friend Igor posted a new video as well (as always in German): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDtfQRsEAHI">Mt. Fuji &amp; das japanische Nachtleben</a></li>
  <li>In Wednesday‚Äôs post, I mentioned that I‚Äôm interested in a new app called ‚ÄúCraft‚Äù. It is a native iOS and macOS application that works somewhat like Notion. Today I found that MacStories reviewed it: <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/craft-review-a-powerful-native-notes-and-collaboration-app/">Craft Review: A Powerful, Native Notes and Collaboration App</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/tPdVXwBI35w">Meanwhile in Finland</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As always, enjoy your Sunday! One last post tomorrow. Of course, I hopefully won‚Äôt stop posting completely, but I definitely need a break as the second half of this month of daily blogging has worn me out a bit. üòÖ</p>
