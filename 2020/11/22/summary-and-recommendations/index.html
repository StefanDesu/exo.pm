<div class="post-content">
  <p>The third week of daily blogging is over! To be honest, I‚Äôm feeling the pressure of coming up with a new post every day, and I think you are feeling it as well, at least judging from the number of comments on my posts. üòÖ</p>

<p>I started the week with a post about <a href="/2020/11/16/japanese-studies/">my Japanese studies</a>. I‚Äôm sure there will be updates about this in the future. On Tuesday, I went back to the past and wrote about <a href="/2020/11/17/abandoned-channel/">my abandoned YouTube channel</a> that I started in 2006. On Wednesday, I talked about <a href="/2020/11/18/nodoka-update-ideas/">my plans for my meditation time app Nodoka</a>. On Thursday, I dove back into the hot topic in the Apple world right now, <a href="/2020/11/19/m1-macs-roundup/">M1 Macs</a>. I promise there won‚Äôt be another post about it this month. üôà On Friday, I talked about <a href="/2020/11/20/too-much-input/">having too much input</a> and being overwhelmed, and yesterday I wrote about the <a href="/2020/11/21/the-voice-inside-your-head/">voice inside your head</a>. I hoped that this last post would stir up some discussions, but maybe y‚Äôall are to busy right now. üòÖ</p>

<p>If you have any ideas for topics I can write about that don‚Äôt require a ton of time (remember, I‚Äôm writing one of these a day), please let me know! Of course I have more things that I‚Äôd like to talk about, but all of those are longer posts that I won‚Äôt be able to write during these daily blogs.</p>

<p>Not too many recommendations for this week:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Related to my Too Much Input post, Nathanial Drew posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHE1cJF3OZs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video about quitting social media for 30 days</a>.</li>
  <li>For those who watched Tenet, you should watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSBtysVymnU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tenet inspired video</a>.</li>
  <li>I randomly stumbled upon this fascinating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xqgvRIUffI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FPV drone video of the Matternhorn</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/IdoD2147Fik" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dumbledore asked calmly</a></li>
  <li>Peter McKinnon made a <a href="https://youtu.be/_MLFSX5cpmE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">really cool video</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have a nice Sunday, everyone!</p>
