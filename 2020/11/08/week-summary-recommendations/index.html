<div class="post-content">
  <p>Do you remember my weekly update update posts? This will be kind of like those back in the day.</p>

<p>So it‚Äôs been a full week of daily blogging for me now! So far it‚Äôs going great I think. It‚Äôs fun and I haven‚Äôt yet run out of things to write about. I‚Äôm usually writing these posts a day in advance, so on the actual day, I only edit my draft and publish it before writing the post for the next day. This has taken some pressure out of this because even if I don‚Äôt have enough time, I could still publish and catch up the next day. Not that that‚Äôs going to happen now that we‚Äôre back in lockdown though. üòÖ</p>

<p>So what have I been writing about? It‚Äôs mostly been catching up. After the <a href="/2020/11/01/nablowrimo/">introductory post</a>, I posted an <a href="/2020/11/02/running-update/">update about running</a>. I actually went for three runs this week with a total distance of 19 km. Good start I think. After an <a href="/2020/11/03/too-much-anime/">admission that I‚Äôm spending too much time watching anime</a>, I posted about my <a href="/2020/11/04/morning-routine/">morning routine</a> and my <a href="/2020/11/05/evening-routine/">evening routine</a>. On Friday, I pre-ordered the iPhone 12 mini and made <a href="/2020/11/06/iPhone-12-mini/">a short post</a> about that. And yesterday, I talked about <a href="/2020/11/07/working-hours-time-management/">working hours and time management</a> which is something that will certainly come up again in these posts.</p>

<p>How did you like this first week of blog posts? Is it too much reading a post every day? Should they be shorter/longer? I think I‚Äôm just going to go with the flow and see where it leads me in terms of topics and length of posts.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in yesterday‚Äôs post, I spend a little too much time on social media and stuff, so here are some things that I found throughout the week that I‚Äôd like to recommend to you (it‚Äôs mostly going to be YouTube videos if I‚Äôm honest):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Instead of wasting time talking about the US election, CGP Grey made a <a href="https://youtu.be/thOifuHs6eY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video about hexagons</a> which I quite enjoyed. Hexagons are indeed the Bestagons.</li>
  <li>DJI announced the Mavic Mini 2 drone, and my favorite tech YouTuber <a href="https://youtu.be/n0WCy1R6mIg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made a video about it</a>. I‚Äôve been talking to a friend about this who has the Mini 1 and I will definitely consider getting one as well, but only if I get back to making regular videos for YouTube. I can‚Äôt justify this purchase if I don‚Äôt actually make videos.</li>
  <li>My friend Igor, who lives in Tokyo, is posting somewhat regularly on YouTube and uploaded <a href="https://youtu.be/C0kIXWfJhp0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video</a> this week. It‚Äôs in German though.</li>
  <li>YouTube‚Äôs algorithm suggesting <a href="https://youtu.be/pXP2sgsfEPk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weird but funny videos</a> to me every time I dare to go to the home tab.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some podcast recommendations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My friend recommended a podcast to me a while ago that I consequently plowed through and now I‚Äôm looking forward to new episodes every week. It‚Äôs Roosterteeth‚Äôs <a href="https://roosterteeth.com/series/f-kface" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">F**kface Podcast</a> with Geoff, Andrew, and Gavin. Prepare to laugh your face off, but start with episode 1 otherwise you won‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on. <a href="https://overcast.fm/+bqTwF2MEw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here‚Äôs</a> the introductory episode and you‚Äôll find links to several places where you can listen to it.</li>
  <li>I liked Yes Theory‚Äôs recent podcast episode <a href="https://yestheory.com/all-podcastss/how-to-make-a-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Make a Change</a> with Rich Roll.</li>
  <li>If you‚Äôre into Apple stuff, I can wholeheartedly recommend <a href="https://atp.fm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ATP</a> and <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connected</a>, two of my favorite podcasts in general simply because of the whole dynamic between the hosts. In this week‚Äôs episodes, apart from usual follow-up and other random topics, they talked a lot about Apple‚Äôs upcoming event next Tuesday where they will likely announce the first Apple Silicon Macs. I plan on writing a blog post about that after the event and explain why this all matters (assuming they actually do announce them).</li>
  <li>I enjoy listening to <a href="https://tim.blog/podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tim Ferriss Show</a> occasionally and I liked the recent episodes with <a href="https://tim.blog/2020/10/14/naval/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Naval Ravikant (#473)</a> and <a href="https://tim.blog/2020/10/26/seth-godin-the-practice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth Godin (#476)</a>, as well as the rerun of <a href="https://tim.blog/2017/02/13/mr-money-mustache/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">episode #221 (as #475) with Mr. Money Mustache</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I really have to make notes about this throughout the week again. It‚Äôs hard to figure out what you have watched/listened to after the fact. üôà</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy this beautiful Sunday!</p>
