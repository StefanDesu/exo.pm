<div class="post-content">
  <p>Hello there, welcome back!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been almost exactly a month since my last post, and I apologize for that. I really messed up and for some reason did not write another post.</p>

<p>So, what happened in these last few weeks?</p>

<p>On the first November weekend, I visited a friend in Berlin. We went bouldering, ate sushi (‚ù§Ô∏è), and saw the new Pok√©mon movie (so nostalgic). Unfortunately, on the day I went there, I started getting sick, and of course I didn‚Äôt properly rest. Even when I was back here, I was very optimistic that it‚Äôll pass and just brushed it off. But of course, it became worse and a week later, I made the decision to just rest for a while. So I took a sick leave from work, drank a lot of tea, slept a lot, took hot baths, and just relaxed. It really helped and after that week, I felt much better. I‚Äôm still not completely recovered even today, but I think it‚Äôs just one of those things that linger around for a while.</p>

<p>During this whole time, I had trouble keeping my routines and everything going, so I‚Äôm still in the process of getting back into that. It‚Äôs especially hard with sleep because my whole sleep schedule is just completely messed up. But it‚Äôs been better the last two or three days, so I‚Äôm optimistic. üôÇ</p>

<p>Exercise is also something that‚Äôs been lacking a lot. While my mind seems to be mostly recovered and working, my body is still a little wonky. I managed to go climbing a few times though and it went better than I first expected. There‚Äôs a lead competition currently going on at our gym, and in just four sessions I managed to climb 21 out of 30 routes. If I hadn‚Äôt been sick and out of shape, two or three more would‚Äôve been possible I think. But it‚Äôs still a really good result!</p>

<p>There‚Äôs been no running this whole time because after being sick, I had something under my foot that‚Äôs still healing and I don‚Äôt want to mess it up again. It‚Äôs also getting really cold, but that‚Äôs just a lame excuse. üòÖ</p>

<p>One thing where I was able to get back into it quickly is iOS programming. Right now, I‚Äôm more excited about it than ever before. I haven‚Äôt finished the book yet, but I was at a point where all the upcoming chapters only introduce additional things that I don‚Äôt yet need for now. So yesterday, I finally started working on my first app. I don‚Äôt really have anything to show yet, but I can tell you that it‚Äôs going to be a simple meditation timer. It‚Äôs something that I use every day and something that‚Äôs easy to do as a starting project. There are already lots of meditation timers on the App Store, but none of those really match what I have in mind. Also, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary to do something completely novel for your first projects. If it‚Äôs an app I want to use myself, I can make it just like I always wanted it to be. And there might be other people who like it as well. Anyway, I‚Äôm working on this and you‚Äôll actually see more about it really soon!</p>

<p>From now on, I‚Äôm going to take more care of my blog. For some reason, my blog seems something that I‚Äôd really like to keep up with, definitely more than some other things like my YouTube channel. So thank you very much for reading and see you soon. Bye!</p>
