<div class="post-content">
  <p>Well, it‚Äôs been a while! Almost a year. I‚Äôve been wanting to get back to writing blog posts, and I thought why not challenge myself to write a post a day for a month? You might have heard of NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) which is usually in November if I remember correctly, so I thought I‚Äôd make NaBloWriMo (National Blog Writing Month) out of that. Apparently, it‚Äôs not something new, even though according to the Twitter account with almost no followers, NoBloWriMo is set in October instead. Well, whatever. ü§∑</p>

<p>A lot has changed in the world since my last post. Way more than anyone could have expected. We‚Äôre now living in a pandemic, currently in its second wave here in Europe. I‚Äôm very lucky to have a job that is both secure and that I can do from home. In fact, I‚Äôve been working from home ever since I‚Äôve been back from Japan in March 2020, and it looks like it will continue for a while. I hope you, dear reader, are doing reasonably well, too!</p>

<p>To be honest though, I don‚Äôt plan to talk much or at all about the pandemic or politics (there‚Äôs an important election coming up that even I couldn‚Äôt avoid). Rather, I simply want to write about what I‚Äôve been up to recently and what my plans are for the not so distant future (I hope). The main purpose for me is to practice writing and develop a habit of writing daily. Actually, I‚Äôve been writing daily journal entries in English for a while now, but since they are personal, I don‚Äôt put much effort into making the language sound good and stuff. So I‚Äôm using this as an excuse to start a habit of writing publicly.</p>

<p>As a teaser, here are some things that I will likely touch upon this month:</p>
<ul>
  <li>new iPhones</li>
  <li>anime</li>
  <li>books</li>
  <li>working hours and time management</li>
  <li>making YouTube videos</li>
  <li>probably lots of random nerdy tech stuff</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now, there is no real feedback mechanism for this blog, so I‚Äôm still considering if it makes sense to set something up. It‚Äôs not like I have many or any readers, but I think getting some feedback, even if it‚Äôs only from people I already know, would be very helpful. Let me know if you have any ideas (<a href="/contact">Contact</a>)!</p>
