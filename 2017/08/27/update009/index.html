<div class="post-content">
  <p>Hello there!</p>

<p>I made it! There was a lot going on this week, and I’m so relieved I made it through.</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, I had another exam, and as always I started studying way too late. I ended up doing most of the studying on Tuesday evening and Wednesday. This definitely wasn’t enough time neither to study all that I needed, nor to actually internalize and understand the material. On several occasions during the exam I had the problem that I just couldn’t remember the connection, I wasn’t able to connect the name of what they wanted explained to the things that I studied. Well, I made it anyway, and got a decent grade as well. I definitely can’t complain. 🙂</p>

<p>A day later I had a phone call with a guy who contacted me on Xing (actually the call was with his colleage). I was a bit nervous about this, but it ended up being a super chilled call and he was a really cool guy! (If there’s anything coming out of this, I’ll let you know here.)</p>

<p>Then on the weekend, I had to catch up on all the work stuff that I’ve been neglecting due to the other things on my mind. So I worked a lot today and yesterday and finished the important task this afternoon! 👍 There are still a few more tasks left, but those are not as time sensitive as today’s was.</p>

<p>This evening, my flatmate and I got ourselves some pizza and watched the…</p>

<p>I guess I’ll leave it at that. (My friend and I will make a podcast about this, but it’ll be in German.)</p>

<p>This is a really big achievement for me! There are 2136 so called 常用漢字 (jouyou kanji = “general use kanji”) and I now know a little more than half of these. I think studying kanji is a lot of fun and I guess I still have quite a lot ahead of me. 😅</p>

<p>Only in Japan. Naturally this made me think of a “gaijin rental” and of course I’m not the first one with the idea. But the guys that did this in 2013/2014 seem to have gone completely inactive. A good business opportunity I guess. 😂</p>

<p>Really good and interesting video about black holes! It’s a lot of speculation, but black holes are just so mind blowing.</p>

A good article explaining that the most important thing is to start, especially in those times when you need to pick up a habit that’s been neglected recently (because of travel, work, …).</p>

<p>Hopefully, I’ll finally have published a new video by then! ✌🏻</p>
