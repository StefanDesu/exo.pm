<div class="post-content">
  <p>You probably know this feeling. In our modern technological world, it‚Äôs easy to consume more and more. And I don‚Äôt mean only purchases, but in this particular case: Information. There is always more articles to read. Always more videos to watch. New movies, TV shows, books, anime. Too many notifications. Too many posts on social media. It‚Äôs just too much.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think our brains are made for this amount of input. I feel like I‚Äôm already kind of protecting myself from information overload, but it still feels like too much.</p>

<p>Recently, I‚Äôm finding myself spending more and more time on Reddit, in particular. I think Reddit is a great platform, I really do. But it‚Äôs also kind of like the internet itself: There are good and bad parts, and there is way more information than a person could ever take in. It‚Äôs also addicting, especially if you find your niche where your interests are. My problem are not the funny cat videos or the memes, but rather things that I‚Äôm really into and that I want to know more about.</p>

<p>Right now, it‚Äôs mostly Apple stuff, as you might have guessed. These new M1 Macs are very exciting, and since they just got released, there is more information about them by the minute (well, it calmed down a little bit). But do I really need to see it all? Isn‚Äôt it enough that I have my few podcasts which I listen to anyway, and who will do a great job summarizing the main points? I think one part of it is that I kind of want to get into the space myself. That‚Äôs why I spent some effort last week writing about Apple Silicon and the event. And the result is definitely that I do know a ton about these things, probably more than anyone should ever know if it isn‚Äôt your job to know. I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs good or bad, but I‚Äôm just not clear if it is what I want.</p>

<p>What I‚Äôve been thinking about is to try an information detox. Maybe one week with as little input as possible. Since I‚Äôm barely leaving my house anyway, it should be doable. The end goal, however, should be to find a good balance. Find sources that I enjoy and that don‚Äôt overwhelm me, and try to keep everything else out.</p>

<p>I also tend to be a digital hoarder. Found something interesting? Immediately save it somewhere to read later. I have lists and lists of things I want to look into. But I never do. Instead of spending my free moments either enjoying the moment itself, or at least dealing with this older stuff that has been waiting for me, I consume more. It‚Äôs never going to have an end.</p>

<p>I still had some vacation days left for this year, so today I decided to take off three days next week. This means that I‚Äôll have five days in a row to tackle some bigger thing. I recently started decluttering some possessions, and I think I should spend at least one of those days with that. But I‚Äôm also thinking about going through <strong>everything</strong> that I hoarded digitally and force myself to make a decision: Is this something that is worth keeping, that I‚Äôm going to look at? What‚Äôs my strategy so that I actually do it?</p>

<p>What do you think? Do you have this problem? I know this is something that I‚Äôm doing to myself. I could just as well let everything go because it doesn‚Äôt really matter anyway. But there‚Äôs always this fear of missing out. There was a reason I saved this link once. Anyway, you know what I mean.</p>
