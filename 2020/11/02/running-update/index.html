<div class="post-content">
  <p>In the past, I‚Äôve talked a lot about running, so I wanted to give an update on this. I‚Äôm pretty sure that I have run more this year than in any year before, but it‚Äôs still on and off. One reason I‚Äôm starting with this topic is that I am getting back into it right now and I need both a plan and some accountability.</p>

<p>First, there‚Äôs some catching up to do though. On 5 February 2020, I randomly ran my first half marathon in Tokyo. Yes, randomly. I was getting back into running and had planned to go on a 5 to 10 km run. I found a nice park near my accommodation where I could run laps and had access to water fountains and a toilet. And for some reason, I got so much into the zone that I just went on and on and on. If I remember correctly, I did not look at my phone or watch between 5 km and 18 km, and at that point, I thought I could just as well go for the half marathon. I ended up running 21.8 km in about 2:30. A fairly slow pace, but it was basically without training at all. For me, it was a big accomplishment because even back in 2017, I never got to the half marathon.</p>

<p>On 9 February, just four days later, I went for another run. I was in Kamakura at that time and it was a nice day, so I wanted to run from there to Enoshima and back. The run was nice and pretty slow with some walking, especially because Enoshima is basically a hill. (I was told afterwards that it might not have been appropriate to run on Enoshima, oops.) When I was back in Kamakura, I was at around 16 km and decided to just go for another half marathon. That was pretty crazy, two half marathons within less than a week with almost no training. (I actually made a YouTube video about that second run: https://youtu.be/Gdc92CUbYO8)</p>

<p>I think one reason I was able to do it was because I‚Äôve been walking a ton during that time in Japan. It wasn‚Äôt unusual for me to walk between 20 and 25 km a day, sometimes up to 30. So my legs were at least a little bit used to it. I also was in a good mental space I think. I was so pumped about running that I actually signed up for a marathon in Japan in April, but that didn‚Äôt happen because of the pandemic, and so far I haven‚Äôt run a marathon (or another half marathon for that matter).</p>

<p>In the months after getting back to Germany, I picked up running again and for a while was able to do it two to three times a week. I wasn‚Äôt going for very long runs, but the habit is important. One problem I have here where I live is that there is no route that is in any way flat. No matter where I go from here, it‚Äôs always steep downhill, so at the very least I need to get back up here. I found a pretty nice 11 km route that I‚Äôve been running a few times, but even that one is pretty steep in total.</p>

<p>The reason I‚Äôm getting back into running now is that I remembered a goal I had: Run a marathon before I‚Äôm turning 30. Well, that‚Äôs only about four months away, so I need to get going!</p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to write about my specific plan later this month, but the plan is roughly to first get going with the habit of three runs a week again, then training on my 11K route, and then running a half marathon on a flat surface in the beginning of December. From then on, I can imagine going for a long run every two weeks, slowly increasing the distance up to 30K or so. And then in February, I‚Äôll go for the full marathon.</p>

<p>Since there won‚Äôt be any organized marathons for a while, I will have to organize it all myself. I was thinking about getting a friend or two to help me out, maybe accompanying me on a bicycle or, if there‚Äôs a lap I can run, setting up a station with drinks and snacks. I think I‚Äôll be able to figure something out even though I won‚Äôt be able to participate in an official marathon event (though I definitely want to do that at some point!).</p>

<p>If you have any tips or recommendations about training for a marathon, feel free to let me know! I realize that 16 weeks is less than what you‚Äôd usually plan for marathon training, but I‚Äôm not aiming to run a particular time, I just want to do it at all. Also, with what happened in February with my random half marathons, I‚Äôm pretty optimistic that I‚Äôll be able to do it. üòÖ</p>
