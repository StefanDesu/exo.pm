<div class="post-content">
  <p>As an effort to procrastinate on studying for the upcoming exam, I now introduce a comment secion under my blog posts! It‚Äôs still under construction, you‚Äôll see that it currently doesn‚Äôt integrate with my theme very well. But it seems to be working!</p>

<p>I just hope I won‚Äôt get spammed to death. I‚Äôm not sure if there are some anti spam modules for this.</p>

<p>By the way, I‚Äôm using a self-hosted comment system named <a href="https://posativ.org/isso/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isso</a> (yes, like the Pokemon). It would have been easier to use something like Disqus, but I really don‚Äôt like to include external libraries and scripts into my blog. So I installed Isso onto my Uberspace (which powers this blog as well) and all is good.</p>

<p>So if you have anything to say about this, please leave a comment below! üòÅ</p>

<p>Update: I tinkered a bit with the CSS and it looks much better now! You might have to empty your browser cache to make it look right though.</p>

    In order to see the comments, you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.
    This website is hosted on GitHub Pages, so I can't serve the comments dynamically.
    The comments are using a self-hosted <a href="https://posativ.org/isso/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isso</a> instance,
    so there's no tracking or anything involved here. üëç
