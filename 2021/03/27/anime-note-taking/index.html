<small class="post-info">by Stefan, 27 March 2021</small>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>Last summer, I started watching an increasing amount of anime, and because I quickly forget the contents of the shows I watch, I started taking notes about each episode. For a while, I did this consistently for every single anime episode I watched, while I was watching it. However, at some point I noticed that I was less attentive due to the fact that I was thinking about what is worth writing down in the middle of the episode. A change was needed.</p>

<p>Currently, this is my strategy: For every anime, I have one Markdown file where I write down the notes. It has the anime‚Äôs name as a heading, then some interesting links or general notes about the anime, followed by a structured list of seasons and episodes. Among the links at the top is one that leads to Reddit‚Äôs search and shows me the episode discussion threads for a particular anime.</p>

<p>What has changed now is that I do <strong>not</strong> take any notes during the episode. Rather, I try to find time shortly after watching it to take notes from memory. This allows me to focus better on the episode while watching it, and also forces me to remember the content of the episode afterwards (which taking notes during the episodes does not). After writing my notes, I go to the respective episode discussion thread and read through that. This further strengthens my memory since I get other people‚Äôs perspective on that episode, including little things that I might have missed. I also copy some of the things people write there into my notes as quotes.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at an example. Just a few days ago, my roommate and I started watching <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/108465/Mushoku-Tensei-Isekai-Ittara-Honki-Dasu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mushoku Tensei</a> which was highly rated in this year‚Äôs winter anime season and which my friend also recommended to me. This is how my document looks like (omitting the actual notes):</p>

<div class="language-md highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gh"># Mushoku Tensei</span>

Good summary of episode 1 including screenshots: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/kuj1bm/mushoku_tensei_isekai_ittara_honki_dasu_episode_1/gis4z3u

<span class="gu">### Episode 2</span>
<span class="p">-</span> [...]
<span class="gt">
&gt; That house needs urgent soundproofing.</span>

[...]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What do you think? Is this completely overkill? I personally think it allows me to get more long-term value and entertainment out of this hobby. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping for. I do enjoy rewatching shows that I REALLY liked, but for some shows, I would like to be able to watch season 2 without having to rewatch season 1 just because my memory is so bad. üòÖ</p>
