<h2 id="exciting-norway-plans">Exciting Norway Plans</h2>

<p>Even though these plans are already 100% certain and happening in my head, they don‚Äôt feel certain enough for me to write a real blog post about them, so I‚Äôm just adding them here for now (for the one person who happens to stumble upon this).</p>

<p>I have exciting news: In January 2025, I‚Äôm going to quit my job and move to Norway! ü•≥ I‚Äôll be moving in with my friends Johanna and Helmut, who I‚Äôve been visiting a lot in Trondheim, especially this year. I love spending time with these two and they are like family to me, so it feels very natural to just live with them. Also, there has been a kind of change this year, that every time I visited them, I felt sad to leave and wanted to stay much longer. I used to look forward to going home and having some time to myself, but that changed. I think that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt seriously considered this move before. I‚Äôve also become more open to Norway in general and have finally started to learn the language (although I‚Äôm still at the very beginning).</p>

<p>This is all very exciting. I have lived abroad twice before, but both times there was a fairly clear time limit on it (both times were in Japan - the first time in 2016/17 for an exchange semester, the second time in 2019/20 for a working holiday that ended somewhat abruptly due to COVID). Of course, even this time it‚Äôs not clear to me or my friends if it will work out in the long run, but I hope it will. There are still some uncertainties, though. The biggest is whether I will find a job there and whether I will like it. As of right now, there are very few IT jobs available in the Trondheim area. I‚Äôm expecting to be unemployed for a couple of months, but I hope to have a job by March 2025. After all, I am going to need income at some point, after all. But I‚Äôm optimistic and I‚Äôm sure it will work out somehow. üôÇ</p>

<p>Anyway, I just wanted to leave this here. There will be more news and a proper blog post (and hopefully some YouTube videos) about this in the coming months (probably after I actually hand in my resignation).</p>

<h2 id="losing-my-grandma">Losing My Grandma</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve been fortunate so far in my life that I haven‚Äôt lost anyone close to me. I did lose my grandma on my father‚Äôs side when I was around 17 or 18, but I wasn‚Äôt very close to her and it didn‚Äôt impact me much (her husband died when I was two or three, so I never met him consciously and it seems like he was‚Ä¶ not a very good person anyway). Since then, some family members got sick or hurt, but it was never anything life-threatening, until now. My grandma (on my mother‚Äôs side), who was an important figure in my early childhood, is currently dying. I knew she had it rough and had been moved back and forth between the care home and the hospital, but it never seemed like the end is imminent. When I visited in May, she had a hard time walking and was in a bit of pain, but she was clear as ever in her head. She told me that she‚Äôs been showing off my postcard from Japan to everyone she meets at the care home. But since then, things have regressed quickly, in particular in the past two weeks or so, and now she‚Äôs not far from death. Twice already the doctors have said she won‚Äôt make the night, though so far she‚Äôs been fighting her way from day to day. The first time a call like this was made, in mid July, I went out of my way to meet her one last time. At first, I almost didn‚Äôt recognize her. She was down to the bone and literally looked like she‚Äôs dying. She was also barely responsive, though she did usually respond to easy yes/no questions. She nodded when I asked her whether she recognized me. But other than that, she wasn‚Äôt able to express anything comprehensible. At times, it was obvious that she was in huge pain, and it was hard to watch. After she was transported to a hospital again, we all visited her for our goodbyes. As of writing this, she did survive four (!) more nights, so who knows what will happen, but I can‚Äôt imagine her recovering to a ‚Äúlivible‚Äù state to be honest. üò¢ The doctors don‚Äôt seem optimistic either, though they did indeed restart treatment after she survived the night she was not supposed to survive.</p>

<p>All that said, I‚Äôm doing fine. It was rough seeing her like that, but I‚Äôm glad I did see her again, and was able to say my goodbyes while she, maybe, still knew who I was. I also took advantage of being in my hometown and visited my grandpa, who with the proud age of 96 years, is now living alone for the first time since marrying my grandma some 65 years or so ago. He‚Äôs doing fairly well, but he‚Äôs a bit lonely and bored. He seemed to cope well with the whole situation. I guess at his age, he‚Äôs had enough experience, with life in general and people around him dying in particular, that he has been able to accept the fact that his wife is now among those people. When we called him, mostly to ask if I could come visit, he immediately asked ‚Äúis it over?‚Äù. It‚Äôs sad, of course, but it also seems like a reasonable way to deal with it.</p>

<h2 id="life-direction">Life Direction</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm currently trying to figure out what my next step in life should be. I actually had something I really wanted to do, but I didn‚Äôt get in. (Post about this coming up sometime soon!) So now I need some alternative. The thing is that I‚Äôm getting a bit too comfortable in my current position, but at the same time, I‚Äôm not fully content with it. This means things need to change, in particular my job.</p>

<p>I haven‚Äôt made any decision so far (and probably won‚Äôt until August at least), but I have some things in mind. One option would be to move in with my friends Johanna and Helmut in Norway! I‚Äôm spending quite a lot of time there every year, and now that they have their own house (and therefore a lot more space), I could imagine just living there (and they‚Äôve been asking me to do this for quite some time now). It would be a pretty big leap though.</p>

<h2 id="traveling">Traveling</h2>

<p>2024 happens to be a very busy year for me. As of July, I‚Äôve spent more time away from home than at home. After almost exactly four years, I was finally able to go back to Japan for an extended vacation. I‚Äôll write a (photo-heavy) post about this trip at some point. I‚Äôm also spending lots of time with my friends in Norway and thoroughly enjoy that time (which is also the reason I‚Äôm considering moving in with them). Being constantly on the road is quite taxing though, so I don‚Äôt actually mind that I (currently) have no plans from September onwards.<sup id="fnref:yet"><a href="#fn:yet" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="blog-update">Blog Update</h2>

<p>I want this blog to be a thing again, even if it‚Äôs just as a personal outlet. There were times when I posted a lot, but in the past three years I‚Äôve barely posted anything. Also, there are some technical issues I want to tackle. I‚Äôve already added a plugin to optimize images, so I plan to post more photos to this blog. But in the long term, I would like to migrate from Jekyll to something like <a href="https://astro.build" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro</a>.</p>

<h2 id="exercise-and-strength-training">Exercise and Strength Training</h2>

<p>In April 2022, so a bit over two years ago, I signed up for a gym membership and started strength training. Over time, I moved from the fancy devices (which are easier and safer for beginners to use, but tend to target few muscle groups at the same time) to barbell training, and now I‚Äôm mostly focused on squats, bench press, overhead press, and deadlift. I think I‚Äôve made good progress in these two years, though the many breaks for traveling and stuff always kind of limit how far I can progress. Also at age 33, I‚Äôm already noticing that my body can‚Äôt take as much at once compared to the past, so I‚Äôm kind of cautious about doing too much. But I‚Äôm really glad that I‚Äôve been pretty consistent in doing strength training, supplemented with lots of stretching and some yoga (I usually go to yoga class once or twice a week, plus a little bit at home). Areas where I‚Äôd like to do more are bouldering and climbing (ever since my climbing partner moved away, I‚Äôve had trouble getting back into it), as well as running (I‚Äôve been doing more again recently, but I‚Äôm concerned about my ankles as they started hurting while/after running).</p>

<p>Fun fact: In June 2024, I finished a 10.6 km run (G√∂ttinger Altstadtlauf) while having COVID. Of course, I didn‚Äôt know at that time. It was the worst 10k run of my life and I could barely walk the day after. It was also a whopping 12 minutes slower than my 2023 time of the same run. Pretty crazy, but at least I finished!</p>
