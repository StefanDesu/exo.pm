<div class="post-content">
  <p>Long time no see, I‚Äôm finally back!</p>

<p>I feel a little ashamed because in the last post I wrote ‚ÄúThere will definitely be a new update post next Sunday‚Äù, but there never was a post. The days before the Denmark vacation were really busy with work, in Denmark my mind was somewhere else all the time, and after Denmark I kind of needed a vacation after the vacation. üôà But that‚Äôs how life is.</p>

<p>There are a few things I‚Äôd like to talk about today. Let me start with something that I already mentioned.</p>

<h2 id="denmark">Denmark</h2>
<p>In 2010, our group of friends from school and some classmates went on a kind of farewell vacation to Denmark. We rented a house there for a week and had a good time relaxing, going to the beach, watching movies, and so on. That was the start of a great tradition. Every year since then we‚Äôve been going to Denmark with our group of friends. The group always changes a little. Some people stop coming, new people join us, sometimes people join again after a few years of absence. This year we were a group of 32 people, exactly double of our initial group size in 2010! We were a little worried about the amount of people, but everything was surprisingly calm and everyone was getting along just fine. Of course there were a few issues that are nearly unavoidable with this many people, but none of those were a big problem.</p>

<p>I really love this tradition because we have an amazing group of friends and most of them I only see a few times a year, so it‚Äôs great to spend a week with them. The house we‚Äôve been renting (we haven‚Äôt changed it in the last 4 years I think) is really nice and big, the beach is awesome, and everyone is having a great time. I‚Äôm looking forward to our next Denmark vacation!</p>

<h2 id="jlpt">JLPT</h2>
<p>I finally applied to take the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) this winter! I wanted to do it this summer, but I missed the application deadline. Because of the additional six months of preparation (well, only two are left now‚Ä¶) I decided to try the N2 which is the second highest level out of five levels. It‚Äôs definitely ambitious and I still have a lot of things to study, but I believe I can do it. The test is on Sunday, 3 December 2017. Wish me luck!</p>

<h2 id="plans-for-october">Plans for October</h2>
<p>I addition to studying Japanese a lot, there are a few things I‚Äôd like to tackle this month:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Veganism</li>
  <li>Getting up early</li>
  <li>Learning iOS programming</li>
</ol>

<p>Some remarks on each of these:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Veganism: In the last couple of weeks, I‚Äôve been trying to eat vegan more and more. The catalyst was talking to a good friend of mine when she was visiting me at the end of July. I‚Äôm mostly eating vegan already, but I‚Äôm doing a lot of exceptions, like ordering pizza or eating cake and sweets. This month, I want to be a little stricter with this and only eat vegan food. The only exceptions will be on family events. There will be at least two family birthdays I‚Äôm attending and while I already told them I‚Äôm not going to eat meat, I won‚Äôt be super picky about strictly eating vegan while I‚Äôm there. I‚Äôm already the only vegetarian in the family as far as I know, so I don‚Äôt want to be the annoying person who has to ask what‚Äôs in there about every single piece of food (well, not yet at least).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Getting up early: At the beginning of this year, I managed to start a great morning routine. I always got up at 6:30, went for a run, took a shower, ate breakfast, and did my Anki. Except for the last part (sometimes I did Anki later in the day), this was consistent for most of January and February. And it felt great! For some reason, it‚Äôs a relief to know that you‚Äôll get up at a certain time no mater what. But ever since I had a running setback in the beginning of March (due to my knee), I haven‚Äôt been able to get back into this routine. Running is not really an option right now, but I want to wake up early again. My goal is to be able to consistently wake up early, let‚Äôs say before 7.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learning iOS programming: At least two times already, I have tried to learn iOS programming, making iPhone apps. Every time it starts out pretty well, but then something comes up and I don‚Äôt have the time anymore. But because I have so many app ideas and I really want to be able to make apps, I‚Äôm going to try this once again this month. I‚Äôm going to make a rough plan today, look up some online classes to take, and make a list of some simple app ideas I can try out. I also want to set specific milestones, something I haven‚Äôt done in earlier attempts. For example, I want to publish my first app to the App Store until the end of the year. It‚Äôs probably going to be a very simple app, but I really want to be able to say that I have an app in the App Store. üòÅ I‚Äôll definitely keep you updated on my progress!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In general, I want to create more. Make apps, make YouTube videos, blog posts, etc. But maybe not everything at the same time, I think that‚Äôs a bit much. üòÖ</p>

<h2 id="more-posts">More Posts?</h2>
<p>I feel a little bad about the lack of blog posts recently, so I want to write more posts really soon! I especially want to continue the ‚ÄúJapan Journey‚Äù posts as it is a way for me to refresh my memories. If I‚Äôm behind on posts again, hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/stefandesu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://telegram.me/stefandesu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telegram</a> and tell me to get my shit together, please. üòÜ</p>

<p>Talk to you soon!</p>
